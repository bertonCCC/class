There are a lot of files this time, so a brief description:

- dmpg17g2.java solves the problem using a segment tree and Segment class
- dmpg17g2.cpp solves the same using C++ (to show that in C++, you can use operator overloading)
- dmpg17g2_2.java solves the problem using a segment tree that doesnt' require you to find an identity (more detail in the comment at the top)
- ds3.java solves Segment Tree Test from last class (Class 31) using an iterative segment tree instead
- dmopc15c1p6.java solves Lelei and Contest using a lazy propagating segment tree
- pacnw16j.java solves Shopping, with detailed notes in the OneNote notebook
